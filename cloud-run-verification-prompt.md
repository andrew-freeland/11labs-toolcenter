# ðŸš¨ URGENT: ElevenLabs Field Structure Verification & Update

## **CRITICAL ISSUE**
The Next.js frontend has been updated to use a unified ElevenLabs field structure, but the Cloud Run service is currently rejecting requests because it expects the old field names. Forms are failing with "Failed to submit to intake service" error due to field name mismatch.

## **VERIFICATION PROMPT FOR CLOUD RUN SERVICE AGENT**

```
URGENT: The Next.js frontend has been updated to use a unified ElevenLabs field structure. The Cloud Run service is currently rejecting requests because it expects the old field names, but the frontend is now sending the new unified structure.

CRITICAL ISSUE: Forms are failing with "Failed to submit to intake service" error because of field name mismatch.

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
1. Update the Cloud Run service to accept the new unified ElevenLabs field structure
2. Ensure all 12 ElevenLabs variables are included
3. Use consistent camelCase naming throughout
4. Use the 'phone' field as the document ID (E.164 format)

NEW SCHEMA TO ACCEPT:
{
  // ElevenLabs Primary Fields (camelCase)
  phone: "string",                 // E.164 format (used as document ID)
  company: "string",
  name: "string", 
  email: "string",
  location: "string",
  constructionType: "string",
  jobTitle: "string",
  companySize: "string",
  painPoints: "string",
  currentTools: "string",
  featureInterest: "array",
  participateFeedback: "boolean",
  
  // System Fields (camelCase)
  contactMethod: "string",         // "text", "phone", or "email"
  isRepeat: "boolean",
  lastContactDate: "string",       // ISO timestamp
  createdDate: "string",           // ISO timestamp
  callCount: "number",             // starts at 1
  licenseNumber: "string",
  businessType: "string",          // "LLC", "INC.", or "Sole Proprietorship"
  languageUsed: "string"           // "en"
}

FIELD MAPPING CHANGES:
- raw_number â†’ phone
- phone_number â†’ phone  
- business_name â†’ company
- contact_name â†’ name
- contact_email â†’ email
- business_address â†’ location
- trade_type â†’ constructionType
- contact_method â†’ contactMethod
- is_repeat â†’ isRepeat
- last_contact_date â†’ lastContactDate
- created_date â†’ createdDate
- call_count â†’ callCount
- license_number â†’ licenseNumber
- business_type â†’ businessType
- language_used â†’ languageUsed

NEW FIELDS TO ACCEPT:
- jobTitle, companySize, painPoints, currentTools, featureInterest, participateFeedback

VALIDATION CONSTRAINTS:
- contactMethod: ['text', 'phone', 'email']
- businessType: ['LLC', 'INC.', 'Sole Proprietorship']
- email: valid email format
- phone: E.164 format
- callCount: non-negative integer
- isRepeat: boolean
- featureInterest: array

DOCUMENT ID: Use the 'phone' field (E.164 format) as the document ID instead of 'phone_number'.

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Service accepts all 12 ElevenLabs variables (phone, company, name, email, location, constructionType, jobTitle, companySize, painPoints, currentTools, featureInterest, participateFeedback)
- [ ] Service accepts all 8 system fields (contactMethod, isRepeat, lastContactDate, createdDate, callCount, licenseNumber, businessType, languageUsed)
- [ ] Service uses 'phone' field as document ID (not random ID)
- [ ] Service validates all field constraints properly
- [ ] Service returns phone number as document ID in response
- [ ] Test payload processes successfully without errors
- [ ] No random document IDs are generated
- [ ] All validation rules are enforced (contactMethod enum, businessType enum, email format, phone E.164, etc.)
- [ ] Service handles both new and existing contacts correctly
- [ ] Call count increments properly for repeat contacts
- [ ] Document ID format is E.164 phone number (e.g., "+14155551212")

Please update the service immediately to fix the form submission errors. Test with the provided payload and confirm all checklist items pass.
